# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Course Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available 
in courser (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).

Files
CodeBook.md describes how to use all the script, variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to 
  clean up the data.
run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analysis described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio 
  by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called secondTidySet.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
